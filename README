These scripts and patches are to build CyanogenMod, Multirom, and Multirom enabled TWRP for the Nvidia Shield devices. Currently supported are the Shield Portable and the Shield Tablet.

These scripts expect to be in the script subdirectory of the build area, such as $HOME/CM-Shield/scripts. Then CM would be in $HOME/CM-Shield/cm and the TWRP build directory would be $HOME/CM-Shield/omni_min.

The main build script (build.all.sh) will clone everything else as needed. Simply clone this repo and run build.all.sh. After everything is synced and build, the output will be in the uploads directory.
